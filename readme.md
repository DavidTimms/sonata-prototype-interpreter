Sonata 
======

A dynamic, functional language which looks similar to Python and behaves similarly to Lisp. Sonata compiles to a JSON intermediate representation which can be run by the interpreter. Both the compiler and interpreter are implemented in JavaScript.

The `tests` directory contains some examples of Sonata code (`.son` files) and the compiled IR (`.son.json` files).

Sonata is still in the early stages of development, so it currently lacks many features and may contain bugs. Documentation will follow when the language reaches a more stable state.
